Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: Simplified data interface has been enabled. The Native PHY will present the data/control interface for the current configuration only. Dynamic reconfiguration of the data interface cannot be supported. The unused_tx_parallel_data and unused_tx_control ports should be connected to 0.
Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: The "tx_pma_div_clkout" port should not be used for register mode data transfers (Relevant parameter: "Enable tx_pma_div_clkout port" (enable_port_tx_pma_div_clkout)).
Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: The "rx_pma_div_clkout" port should not be used for register mode data transfers (Relevant parameter: "Enable rx_pma_div_clkout port" (enable_port_rx_pma_div_clkout)).
Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: Note - When dynamic reconfiguration is enabled, users are recommended to enable multiple reconfiguration profiles for Quartus to perform robust timing closure
Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: For the selected device(10AT115S2F45E2SG), transceiver speed grade is 2 and core speed grade is 2.
Info: Phy.xcvr_native_a10_0: Note - The external TX PLL IP must be configured with an output clock frequency of 5156.25 MHz.
